<h2>My Feedback Regarding Summer Camp2024 program</h2>
<p>I would like to thank CITCS-Computering Intelligence Training and Consultancy Services for their releentless
   efforts and encoouragments during our Summer Camp2024 program.I learned web devlopment scripts/languages 
   from the basic level. This summer camp inspired me to work more to be a good computer programmer and
   innvote my ideas to solve the arising society problems. I promise to work hard to my computing skills,
   and surely I will apply for the coming year's  Summer Camp anywhere.
